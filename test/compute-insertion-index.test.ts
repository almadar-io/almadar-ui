/**
 * `computeInsertionIndex` regression: `resolveL2Path` in OrbPreviewNode.tsx
 * used to feed it raw `getBoundingClientRect()` rects off UISlotRenderer's
 * `display:contents` child wrappers — those are always 0x0, so `mid` was
 * always 0 and the pointer position never won a `pos < mid` comparison,
 * meaning every drop appended to the end. The fix moved rect resolution to
 * the caller (union boxes via `absUnion`); this pure function just does the
 * geometry, so these tests exercise it directly with hand-built rects.
