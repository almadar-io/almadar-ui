      "Explain in your own words how photosynthesis benefits the ecosystem.",

      "Photosynthesis benefits the ecosystem in several ways:\n\n1. **Oxygen Production**: It releases oxygen as a byproduct, which is essential for aerobic organisms\n2. **Carbon Dioxide Removal**: It removes CO₂ from the atmosphere, helping regulate climate\n3. **Food Chain Foundation**: It creates glucose that forms the base of most food chains\n4. **Energy Conversion**: It transforms solar energy into chemical energy that can be used by other organisms",

After one week, compare the plants\n5. The plant in darkness will show yellowing leaves and reduced growth, demonstrating that light is essential for photosynthesis",

      "Assess the potential impact of deforestation on global photosynthesis rates and climate change. Is this a significant concern?",
    answer:
      "**Assessment:**\n\nDeforestation significantly impacts global photosynthesis and climate:\n\n1. **Reduced Carbon Sequestration**: Fewer trees means less CO₂ absorbed\n2. **Positive Feedback Loop**: Less photosynthesis → more atmospheric CO₂ → more warming → more forest fires → less photosynthesis\n3. **Oxygen Production**: While oceans produce most oxygen, forests are crucial for land-based ecosystems\n\n**Verdict:** This is a critical concern. The Amazon alone absorbs ~2 billion tons of CO₂ annually. Its destruction would accelerate climate change significantly.",
