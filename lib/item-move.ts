/**
 * Item movement — a row that changes place glides from where it was to where

 * lists share, so a card that leaves one column and mounts in another glides
 * across. Off when the theme sets `--motion-enable: off` or the OS asks for
 * reduced motion; timing is the theme's `--duration-slow` / `--easing-emphasized`.
